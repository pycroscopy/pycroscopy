.. _Description:
0. Description
--------------
A `python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy,
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
Classes implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at `Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) <http://www.ornl.gov/>`_.

.. _structure:

1. Package Structure
--------------------
The package structure is simple, with 4 main modules:
   1. `io`: Input/Output from custom & proprietary microscope formats to HDF5.
   2. `processing`: Multivariate Statistics, Machine Learning, and Filtering.
   3. `analysis`: Model-dependent analysis of image information.
   4. `viz`: Visualization and interactive slicing of high-dimensional data by lightweight Qt viewers.

Once a user converts their microscope's data format into an HDF5 format, by simply extending some of the classes in `io`, the user gains access to the rest of the utilities present in `pycroscopy.*`. 

.. _Installation:

2. Installation
---------------
Pycroscopy requires many commonly used python packages such as numpy, scipy etc. To simplify the installation process, we recommend the installation of Anaconda which contains most of the prerequisite packages as well as a development environment - Spyder. 

Pycroscopy was initially developed in python 2 but all current / future development for pycroscopy will be on python 3.5+. Nonetheless, we will do our best to ensure continued compatibility with python 2. 

   1. Recommended - uninstall existing Python distribution(s) if installed.  Restart computer afterwards.

   2. Install Anaconda 4.2 (Python 3.5) 64-bit -  `Mac <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg>`_ / `Windows <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_ / `Linux <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh>`_
	  
   3. Install pycroscopy - Open a terminal (mac / linux) or command prompt (windows - if possible with administrator priveleges) and type:
   	
	.. code:: bash

	   pip install pycroscopy
         
   4. Enjoy pycroscopy!
   
If you already have pycroscopy installed and want to update to the latest version, use the following command:

.. code:: bash
  pip install -U pycroscopy
   
If you would like to quickly view HDF5 files generated by and used in pycroscopy, we recommend `HDF View <https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_

3. API and Documentation
------------------------
* See our `homepage <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/>`_ for more information
* Our api (documentation for our functions and classes) is available `here <http://pycroscopy.readthedocs.io/>`_

.. _resources:

4. Examples and Resources
-------------------------
* We use `jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_ for our scientific workflows. This `youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk>`_ provides a nice overview on jupyter notebooks. 
* Our jupyter notebooks are available `here <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/>`_ and many of our notebooks are tied to journal publications (see below).
* Videos and other tutorials are available at the `Institute For Functional Imaging of Materials <http://ifim.ornl.gov/resources.html>`_
