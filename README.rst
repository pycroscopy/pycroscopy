What is pycroscopy?
-------------------
pycroscopy is a `python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.

With  `pycroscopy <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/>`_ we aim to:
	1. Serve as a hub for collaboration across scientific domains (microscopists, material scientists, biologists...)
	2. provide a community-developed, open standard for data formatting 
	3. provide a framework for developing data analysis routines 
	4. significantly lower the barrier to advanced data analysis procedures by simplifying I/O, processing, visualization, etc.

To learn more about the motivation, general structure, and philosophy of pycroscopy, please read this `short introduction <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/docs/pycroscopy_2017_07_11.pdf>`_.

Package Structure
-----------------
The package structure is simple, with 4 main modules:
   1. `io`: Input/Output from custom & proprietary microscope formats to HDF5.
   2. `processing`: Multivariate Statistics, Machine Learning, and Filtering.
   3. `analysis`: Model-dependent analysis of information.
   4. `viz`: Plotting functions and interactive jupyter widgets to visualize multidimenional data

Once a user converts their microscope's data format into an HDF5 format, by simply extending some of the classes in `io`, the user gains access to the rest of the utilities present in `pycroscopy.*`. 

Installation
------------

Pycroscopy requires many commonly used python packages such as numpy, scipy etc. To simplify the installation process, we recommend the installation of Anaconda which contains most of the prerequisite packages as well as a development environment - Spyder. 

   0. Recommended - uninstall existing Python distribution(s) if installed.  Restart computer afterwards.

   1. Install Anaconda 4.2 (Python 3.5) 64-bit -  `Mac <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg>`_ / `Windows <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_ / `Linux <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh>`_

   2. Install pycroscopy - Open a terminal (mac / linux) or command prompt (windows - if possible with administrator priveleges) and type:

	.. code:: bash

	   pip install pycroscopy

   3. Enjoy pycroscopy!

If you already have pycroscopy installed and want to update to the latest version, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

  pip install -U --no-deps pycroscopy
  
If it does not work try reinstalling the package:

.. code:: bash

  pip uninstall pycroscopy
  pip install pycroscopy

If you would like to quickly view HDF5 files generated by and used in pycroscopy, we recommend `HDF View <https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Pycroscopy was initially developed in python 2 but all current / future development for pycroscopy will be on python 3.5+. Nonetheless, we will do our best to ensure continued compatibility with python 2. 
* We currently do not support 32 bit architectures

Getting Started
---------------
* Follow the instructions above to install pycroscopy
* See how we use pycroscopy for our scientific research in these `jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/>`_. Many of them are linked to journal publications listed below.
	* Please see the official `jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`_ website for more information about notebooks and consider watching this `youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk>`_.
* See our `examples <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to get started on using and writing your own pycroscopy functions
* Videos and other tutorials are available at the `Institute For Functional Imaging of Materials <http://ifim.ornl.gov/resources.html>`_ 
* For more information about our functions and classes, please see our `API <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/pycroscopy.html>`_
* We have many translators that transform data from popular microscope data formats to pycroscopy compatible .h5 files. We also have `tutorials to get you started on importing your data to pycroscopy <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/plot_translator_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-translator-tutorial-py>`_. 
* Details regarding the defention, implementation, and guidelines for pycroscopy's `data format <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/docs/Data_Format.md>`_ for `HDF5 <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/docs/Pycroscopy_Data_Formatting.pdf>`_ are also available.
