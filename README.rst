**NOTE: Pycroscopy is undergoing a major reorganization and change to the scope and nature of the package. For those interested in the older version, please visit the legacy branch. The new version is under development in the 'phoenix' branch, and this is now the default branch.**

pycroscopy is a `python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. pycroscopy uses a data-centric model wherein the raw data collected from the microscope, results from analysis and processing routines are all written to standardized hierarchical data format (HDF5) files for traceability, reproducibility, and provenance.

Please visit our `homepage <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/about.html>`_ for more information and installation instructions.

If you use pycroscopy for research, we would appreciate if you could cite our `Arxiv paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09515>`_ titled "USID and Pycroscopy - Open frameworks for storing and analyzing spectroscopic and imaging data"
