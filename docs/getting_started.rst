Getting Started
---------------
* Follow `these instructions <./install.html>`_ to install pycroscopy
* See the many `journal publications <./papers_conferences.html>`_ made possible by pycroscopy and try out the jupyter notebooks that were used for the paper
* Also see `examples <./auto_examples/index.html>`_ to see other scientific applications of pycroscopy
* Python novices are highly recommended to go through **Nick Mostovych's** `guides and pitfalls for python novices <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/getting_started.html#guide-for-python-novices>`_
* We have also compiled a list of `handy tutorials <./external_guides.html>`_ on basic / prerequisite topics such as programming in python, data analytics, machine learning, etc.
* See `tutorials <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to get started on using and writing your own pyUSID functions that power pycroscopy
* We already have `many translators <./translators.html>`_ that transform data from popular microscope data formats to pycroscopy compatible HDF5 files.
    * pyUSID also has a `tutorial  <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/auto_examples/beginner/plot_numpy_translator.html>`_ to get you started on importing your other data to pycroscopy.
* Details regarding the definition and guidelines for the Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data `(USID) <../../USID/index.html>`_ model and implementation in HDF5 are also available in pyUSID's documentation.
* If you are interested in contributing your code to pycroscopy, please look at our `guidelines <./contribution_guidelines.html>`_
* If you need detailed documentation on all our classes, functions, etc., what is where any why, please visit our `API <./api.html>`_
* Have questions? See our `FAQ <./faq.html>`_ to see if we have already answered them.
