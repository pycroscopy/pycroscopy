Tutorial 1: Data Translation
======================================================================================

**Suhas Somnath**
8/8/2017

This set of tutorials will serve as examples for developing end-to-end workflows for and using pycroscopy.

**In this example, we extract data and parameters from a Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy (STS) raw data file, as
obtained from an Omicron STM, and write these to a pycroscopy compatible data file.**


Prerequisites:
==============

Before proceeding with this example series, we recommend reading the previous documents to learn more about:

1. Data and file formats
    * Why you should care about data formats
    * Current state of data formats in microscopy
    * Structuring data in pycroscopy

2. HDF5 file format


Introduction to Data Translation
================================

Before any data analysis, we need to access data stored in the raw file(s) generated by the microscope. Often, the
data and parameters in these files are **not** straightforward to access. In certain cases, additional / dedicated
software packages are necessary to access the data while in many other cases, it is possible to extract the necessary
information from built-in **numpy** or similar python packages included with **anaconda**.

Pycroscopy aims to make data access, storage, curation, etc. simply by storing the data along with all
relevant parameters in a single **.hdf5** or **.h5** file.

The process of copying data from the original format to **pycroscopy compatible hdf5 files** is called
**Translation** and the classes available in pycroscopy that perform these operation are called **Translators**


Writing Your First Data Translator
==================================

**The goal in this section is to trandslate the .asc file obtained from an Omicron microscope into a pycroscopy
compatible .h5 file.**

While there is an **AscTranslator** avialable in pycroscopy that can translate these files in just a **single** line,
we will intentionally assume that no such translator is avialable. Using a handful of useful functions in pycroscopy,
we will translate the files from the source **.asc** format to the pycroscopy compatible **.h5** in just a few lines.
The code developed below is essentially the **AscTranslator**. The same methodology can be used to translate other data
formats


Setting up the notebook
=======================

There are a few setup procedures that need to be followed before any code is written. In this step, we simply load a
few python packages that will be necessary in the later steps.





.. code-block:: python


    # Ensure python 3 compatibility:
    from __future__ import division, print_function, absolute_import, unicode_literals

    # The package for accessing files in directories, etc.:
    import os

    # Warning package in case something goes wrong
    from warnings import warn

    # Package for downloading online files:
    try:
        # This package is not part of anaconda and may need to be installed.
        import wget
    except ImportError:
        warn('wget not found.  Will install with pip.')
        import pip
        pip.main(['install', 'wget'])
        import wget

    # The mathematical computation package:
    import numpy as np

    # The package used for creating and manipulating HDF5 files:
    import h5py

    # Packages for plotting:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Finally import pycroscopy for certain scientific analysis:
    try:
        import pycroscopy as px
    except ImportError:
        warn('pycroscopy not found.  Will install with pip.')
        import pip
        pip.main(['install', 'pycroscopy'])
        import pycroscopy as px







0. Select the Raw Data file
===========================
Download the data file from Github:



.. code-block:: python

    url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/master/data/STS.asc'
    data_file_path = 'temp_1.asc'
    if os.path.exists(data_file_path):
        os.remove(data_file_path)
    _ = wget.download(url, data_file_path, bar=None)







1. Exploring the Raw Data File
==============================

Inherently, one may not know how to read these **.asc** files. One option is to try and read the file as a text file
one line at a time.

It turns out that these .asc files are effectively the standard **ASCII** text files.

Here is how we tested to see if the **asc** files could be interpreted as text files. Below, we read just thefirst 10
lines in the file



.. code-block:: python


    with open(data_file_path, 'r') as file_handle:
        for lin_ind in range(10):
            print(file_handle.readline())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    # y-length = 29.7595

    # x-offset = -967.807

    # y-offset = -781.441

    # z-points = 500


2. Loading the data
===================
Now that we know that these files are simple text files, we can manually go through the file to find out which lines
are important, at what lines the data starts etc.
Manual investigation of such .asc files revealed that these files are always formatted in the same way. Also, they
contain parameters in the first 403 lines and then contain data which is arranged as one pixel per row.
STS experiments result in 3 dimensional datasets (X, Y, current). In other words, a 1D array of current data (as a
function of excitation bias) is sampled at every location on a two dimensional grid of points on the sample.
By knowing where the parameters are located and how the data is structured, it is possible to extract the necessary
information from these files.
Since we know that the data sizes (<200 MB) are much smaller than the physical memory of most computers, we can start
by safely loading the contents of the entire file to memory



.. code-block:: python


    # Extracting the raw data into memory
    file_handle = open(data_file_path, 'r')
    string_lines = file_handle.readlines()
    file_handle.close()







3. Read the parameters
======================
The parameters in these files are present in the first few lines of the file



.. code-block:: python


    # Reading parameters stored in the first few rows of the file
    parm_dict = dict()
    for line in string_lines[3:17]:
        line = line.replace('# ', '')
        line = line.replace('\n', '')
        temp = line.split('=')
        test = temp[1].strip()
        try:
            test = float(test)
            # convert those values that should be integers:
            if test % 1 == 0:
                test = int(test)
        except ValueError:
            pass
        parm_dict[temp[0].strip()] = test

    # Print out the parameters extracted
    for key in parm_dict.keys():
        print(key, ':\t', parm_dict[key])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    x-pixels :       100
    z-range :        2000000000
    y-offset :       -781.441
    scanspeed :      59519000000
    z-offset :       1116.49
    z-points :       500
    x-length :       29.7595
    voidpixels :     0
    y-pixels :       100
    z-unit :         nV
    z-section :      491
    x-offset :       -967.807
    value-unit :     nA
    y-length :       29.7595


3.a Prepare to read the data
============================
Before we read the data, we need to make an empty array to store all this data. In order to do this, we need to read
the dictionary of parameters we made in step 2 and extract necessary quantities



.. code-block:: python


    num_rows = int(parm_dict['y-pixels'])
    num_cols = int(parm_dict['x-pixels'])
    num_pos = num_rows * num_cols
    spectra_length = int(parm_dict['z-points'])







3.b Read the data
=================
Data is present after the first 403 lines of parameters.



.. code-block:: python


    # num_headers = len(string_lines) - num_pos
    num_headers = 403

    # Extract the STS data from subsequent lines
    raw_data_2d = np.zeros(shape=(num_pos, spectra_length), dtype=np.float32)
    for line_ind in range(num_pos):
        this_line = string_lines[num_headers + line_ind]
        string_spectrum = this_line.split('\t')[:-1]  # omitting the new line
        raw_data_2d[line_ind] = np.array(string_spectrum, dtype=np.float32)







4.a Preparing some necessary parameters
=======================================



.. code-block:: python


    max_v = 1 # This is the one parameter we are not sure about

    folder_path, file_name = os.path.split(data_file_path)
    file_name = file_name[:-4] + '_'

    # Generate the x / voltage / spectroscopic axis:
    volt_vec = np.linspace(-1 * max_v, 1 * max_v, spectra_length)

    h5_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name + '.h5')







4b. Calling the NumpyTranslator to create the pycroscopy data file
==================================================================
The NumpyTranslator simplifies the ceation of pycroscopy compatible datasets. It handles the file creation,
dataset creation and writing, creation of ancillary datasets, datagroup creation, writing parameters, linking
ancillary datasets to the main dataset etc. With a single call to the NumpyTranslator, we complete the translation
process.



.. code-block:: python


    tran = px.io.NumpyTranslator()
    h5_path = tran.translate(h5_path, raw_data_2d, num_rows, num_cols,
                             qty_name='Current', data_unit='nA', spec_name='Bias',
                             spec_unit='V', spec_val=volt_vec, scan_height=100,
                             scan_width=200, spatial_unit='nm', data_type='STS',
                             translator_name='ASC', parms_dict=parm_dict)







Notes on pycroscopy translation
===============================
* Steps 1-3 would be performed anyway in order to begin data analysis
* The actual pycroscopy translation step are reduced to just 3-4 lines in step 4.
* While this approach is feasible and encouraged for simple and small data, it may be necessary to use lower level
  calls to write efficient translators

Verifying the newly written H5 file:
====================================
* We will only perform some simple and quick verification to show that the data has indeed been translated corectly.
* Please see the next notebook in the example series to learn more about reading and accessing data.



.. code-block:: python


    with h5py.File(h5_path, mode='r') as h5_file:
        # See if a tree has been created within the hdf5 file:
        px.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_file)

        h5_main = h5_file['Measurement_000/Channel_000/Raw_Data']
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(11, 5))
        spat_map = np.reshape(h5_main[:, 100], (100, 100))
        px.plot_utils.plot_map(axes[0], spat_map, origin='lower')
        axes[0].set_title('Spatial map')
        axes[0].set_xlabel('X')
        axes[0].set_ylabel('Y')
        axes[1].plot(np.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, h5_main.shape[1]),
                     h5_main[250])
        axes[1].set_title('IV curve at a single pixel')
        axes[1].set_xlabel('Tip bias [V]')
        axes[1].set_ylabel('Current [nA]')

    # Remove both the original and translated files:
    os.remove(h5_path)
    os.remove(data_file_path)
