Data Translators
=================
* Pycroscopy uses ``Translators`` to extract data and metadata from files (often measurement data stored in instrument-generated proprietary file formats) and write them into `Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data (USID) HDF5 files <../../pyUSID/data_format.html>`_.
* You can write your own ``Translator`` easily by following `this example <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_numpy_translator.html>`_ on our sister project's documentation.
* Below is a list of ``Translators`` already available in pycroscopy to translate data.
* These translators can be accessed via ``pycroscopy.io.translators`` or ``pycroscopy.translators``
* We tend to add new ``Translators`` to this list frequently.

  * We understand that this list does not (yet) comprehensively cover all modalities and instrument manufacturers, but we are working towards a comprehensive set of translators.
  * We only have access to a small subset of all available instruments and data which limits our ability to add more translators.
  * Given that this is a **community-driven effort**, you can help by providing:

    * Example datasets (scans, force curves, spectra, force-maps, spectra acquired on grids of locations, etc.)
    * Links to existing packages that have figured out how to extract this data. (More often than not, there are researchers who have put up their code)
    * Your own code for extracting data. We invite you to come onboard and add your tools to the package.
    * Guidance in correctly extracting the metadata (parameters) and data
    * Your time. We are interested in collaborating with you to develop translators.
* We are also interested in collaborating with instrument manufacturers to integrate pycroscopy into instrumentation or analysis software.
* We are working on writing translators to popular open-source software / formats such as ``WSxM``, ``Gwyddion``, and ``ImageJ``.
