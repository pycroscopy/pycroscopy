Installation
============

Preparing for pycroscopy
------------------------
`Pycroscopy <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy>`_ requires many commonly used scientific and numeric python packages such as numpy, scipy etc. To simplify the installation process, we recommend the installation of Anaconda which contains most of the prerequisite packages, `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ - a package / environment manager, as well as an `interactive development environment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`_ - `Spyder <https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-introduction/lecture/ywcuv/introduction-to-the-spyder-ide>`_. 

   1. Recommended - uninstall existing Python distribution(s) if installed.  Restart computer afterwards.

   2. Install Anaconda 4.2 (Python 3.5) 64-bit -  `Mac <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg>`_ / `Windows <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_ / `Linux <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh>`_
   
Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Pycroscopy was initially developed in python 2 but all current / future development for pycroscopy will be on python 3.5+. Nonetheless, we will do our best to ensure continued compatibility with python 2. 
* We currently do not support 32 bit architectures
   
Installing pycroscopy
---------------------
Once the appropriate Anaconda distribtuion has been successfully installed, pycroscopy can be installed easily either via the python package index (pypi / pip) or conda-forge (conda). 

pip installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open a terminal (mac / linux) or command prompt (windows - be sure to install in a location where you have write access.  Don't install as administrator unless you are required to do so.) and type:
   	
.. code:: bash

  pip install pycroscopy
  
conda installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, open a terminal / command window. Add `conda-forge` to your channels with:

.. code:: bash

  conda config --append channels conda-forge

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `pycroscopy` can be installed with:

.. code:: bash

  conda install pycroscopy
  
Installing from a specific branch (advanced users **ONLY**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, we are installing pycroscopy from the latest development branch. Note that we do not recommend installing pycroscopy this way. 

Before you can install pycroscopy, you need to install git.

.. code:: bash

  conda install git

Once git has installed, you can install a specific branch of pycroscopy (``dev`` in this case):

.. code:: bash

  pip install -U git+https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy@dev

  
Updating pycroscopy
-------------------

We recommend periodically updating your anaconda distribution.  To fully update run the following commands in a terminal / command window.

.. code:: bash

    conda upgrade anaconda
    conda update --all

If you installed pycroscopy via conda, the last command should update pycroscopy as well. 

Updating via conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you installed pycroscopy via `conda`, open a terminal / command window and type:

.. code:: bash

  conda update pycroscopy

Updating via pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have pycroscopy installed and want to update to the latest version, use the following command in a terminal / command window:

.. code:: bash

  pip install -U --no-deps pycroscopy
  
If it does not work try reinstalling the package:

.. code:: bash

  pip uninstall pycroscopy
  pip install pycroscopy
  
Other software
--------------
We recommend `HDF View <https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ for exploring HDF5 files generated by and used in pycroscopy.
