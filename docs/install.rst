Installation
------------

`Pycroscopy <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy>`_ requires many commonly used python packages such as numpy, scipy etc. To simplify the installation process, we recommend the installation of Anaconda which contains most of the prerequisite packages as well as a development environment - Spyder. 

   1. Recommended - uninstall existing Python distribution(s) if installed.  Restart computer afterwards.

   2. Install Anaconda 4.2 (Python 3.5) 64-bit -  `Mac <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg>`_ / `Windows <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_ / `Linux <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh>`_
	  
   3. Install pycroscopy - Open a terminal (mac / linux) or command prompt (windows - if possible with administrator priveleges) and type:
   	
	.. code:: bash

	   pip install pycroscopy
         
   4. Enjoy pycroscopy!
 
We recommend `HDF View <https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ for exploring HDF5 files generated by and used in pycroscopy.
   
Updating
~~~~~~~~

If you already have pycroscopy installed and want to update to the latest version, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

  pip install -U --no-deps pycroscopy
  
If it does not work try reinstalling the package:

.. code:: bash

  pip uninstall pycroscopy
  pip install pycroscopy

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Pycroscopy was initially developed in python 2 but all current / future development for pycroscopy will be on python 3.5+. Nonetheless, we will do our best to ensure continued compatibility with python 2. 
* We currently do not support 32 bit architectures
