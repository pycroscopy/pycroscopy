# Main Datasets in Pycroscopy
# -----------------------------
# In pycroscopy, all spatial dimensions are collapsed to a single dimension and, similarly, all spectroscopic dimensions
# are also collapsed to a single dimension. Thus, the data is stored as a two-dimensional (N x P) matrix with N spatial
# locations each with P spectroscopic datapoints.
# 
# This general and intuitive format allows imaging data from any instrument, measurement scheme, size, or dimensionality
# to be represented in the same way. Such an instrument independent data format enables a single set of analysis and
# processing functions to be reused for multiple image formats or modalities.
#
# ``Main datasets`` are greater than the sum of their parts. They are more capable and information-packed than
# conventional datasets since they have (or are linked to) all the necessary information to describe a measured dataset.
# The additional information contained / linked by ``Main datasets`` includes:
#
# * the recorded physical quantity
# * units of the data
# * names of the position and spectroscopic dimensions
# * dimensionality of the data in its original N dimensional form etc.
#
# PycroDatasets = Main Datasets
# ------------------------------
# Regardless, ``Main datasets`` are just concepts or blueprints and not concrete digital objects in a programming language
# or a file. ``PycroDatasets`` are **tangible representations of Main datasets**. From an implementation perspective, the
# PycroDataset class extends the ``h5py.Dataset object``. In other words, PycroDatasets have all the capabilities of
# standard HDF5 / h5py Dataset objects but are supercharged from a scientific perspective since they:
#
# * are self-describing
# * allow quick interactive visualization in Jupyter notebooks
# * allow intuitive slicing of the N dimensional dataset
# * and much much more.
#
# While it is most certainly possible to access this information and enable these functionalities via the native ``h5py``
# functionality, it can become tedious very quickly.  In fact, a lot of the functionality of PycroDataset comes from
# orchestration of multiple functions in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils`` outlined in other documents. The PycroDataset class
# makes such necessary information and functionality easily accessible.
#
# Since Main datasets are the hubs of information in a Pycroscopy formatted HDF5 file, we expect that the majority of
# the data interrogation will happen via PycroDatasets
#
# Recommended pre-requisite reading

# * `pycroscopy data format <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/data_format.html>`_
# * `Crash course on HDF5 and h5py <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_h5py.html>`_
# * Utilities for `reading <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_hdf_utils_read.html>`_

#
# Example scientific dataset
# ---------------------------
#
# Before, we dive into the functionalities of PycroDatasets we need to understand the dataset that will be used in this
# example. For this example, we will be working with a Band Excitation Polarization Switching (BEPS) dataset acquired
# from advanced atomic force microscopes. In the much simpler Band Excitation (BE) imaging datasets, a single spectra
# is acquired at each location in a two dimensional grid of spatial locations. Thus, BE imaging datasets have two
# position dimensions (X, Y) and one spectroscopic dimension (frequency - against which the spectra is recorded). The
# BEPS dataset used in this example has a spectra for each combination of three other parameters (DC offset, Field, and
# Cycle). Thus, this dataset has three new spectral dimensions in addition to the spectra itself. Hence, this dataset
# becomes a 2+4 = 6 dimensional dataset
#
# Load all necessary packages
# ---------------------------
#
# First, we need to load the necessary packages. Here are a list of packages, besides pycroscopy, that will be used in
# this example:
#
# * ``h5py`` - to open and close the file
# * ``wget`` - to download the example data file
# * ``numpy`` - for numerical operations on arrays in memory
# * ``matplotlib`` - basic visualization of data

from __future__ import print_function, division, unicode_literals
import os
# Warning package in case something goes wrong
from warnings import warn
import subprocess
import sys

def install(package):
    subprocess.call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])
# Package for downloading online files:
try:
    # This package is not part of anaconda and may need to be installed.
    import wget
except ImportError:
    warn('wget not found.  Will install with pip.')
    import pip
    install('wget')
    import wget
import h5py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
try:
    import pycroscopy as px
except ImportError:
    warn('pycroscopy not found.  Will install with pip.')
    import pip
    install('pycroscopy')
    import pycroscopy as px

########################################################################################################################
# Load the dataset
# -----------------
# First, lets download example HDF5 file from the pycroscopy Github project:

url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/master/data/BEPS_small.h5'
h5_path = 'temp.h5'
_ = wget.download(url, h5_path, bar=None)

print('Working on:\n' + h5_path)

########################################################################################################################
# Next, lets open this HDF5 file in read-only mode. Note that opening the file does not cause the contents to be
# automatically loaded to memory. Instead, we are presented with objects that refer to specific HDF5 datasets,
# attributes or groups in the file

h5_path = 'temp.h5'
h5_f = h5py.File(h5_path, mode='r')

########################################################################################################################
# Here, ``h5_f`` is an active handle to the open file.
# Lets quickly look at the contents of this HDF5 file using a handy function in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils`` - ``print_tree()``

print('Contents of the H5 file:')
px.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_f)

########################################################################################################################
# For this example, we will only focus on the ``Raw_Data`` dataset which contains the 6D raw measurement data. First lets
# access the HDF5 dataset and check if it is a ``Main`` dataset in the first place:

h5_raw = h5_f['/Measurement_000/Channel_000/Raw_Data']
print(h5_raw)
print('h5_raw is a main dataset? {}'.format(px.hdf_utils.check_if_main(h5_raw)))

########################################################################################################################
# It turns out that this is indeed a Main dataset. Therefore, we can turn this in to a Pycrodataset without any
# problems.
#
# Creating a PycroDataset
# -----------------------
# All one needs for creating a PycroDataset object is a Main dataset. Here is how we can supercharge h5_raw:

pd_raw = px.PycroDataset(h5_raw)
print(pd_raw)

########################################################################################################################
# Notice how easy it was to create a PycroDataset object. Also, note how the PycroDataset is much more informative in
# comparison with the conventional h5py.Dataset object.
#
# PycroDataset = Supercharged(h5py.Dataset)
# =========================================
# Remember that PycroDataset is just an extension of the h5py.Dataset object class. Therefore, both the ``h5_raw`` and
# ``pd_raw`` refer to the same object as the following equality test demonstrates. Except ``pd_raw`` knows about the
# ``ancillary datasets`` and other information which makes it a far more powerful object for you.


print(pd_raw == h5_raw)

########################################################################################################################
# Easier access to information
# ----------------------------
# Since the PycroDataset is aware and has handles to the supporting ancillary datasets, they can be accessed as
# properties of the object unlike HDF5 datasets. Note that these ancillary datasets can be accessed using functionality
# in pycroscopy.hdf_utils as well. However, the PycroDataset option is far easier.
#
# Let us compare accessing the Spectroscopic Indices via the PycroDataset and hdf_utils functionality:

h5_spec_inds_1 = pd_raw.h5_spec_inds
h5_spec_inds_2 = px.hdf_utils.get_auxiliary_datasets(h5_raw, 'Spectroscopic_Indices')[0]
print(h5_spec_inds_1 == h5_spec_inds_2)

########################################################################################################################
# In the same vein, it is also easy to access **string descriptors** of the ancillary datasets and the Main dataset.
# The ``hdf_utils`` alternatives to these operations / properties also exist and are discussed in an alternate document,
# but will not be discussed here for brevity.:

print('Desctiption of physical quantity in the Main dataset:')
print(pd_raw.data_descriptor)
print('Position Dimension names and sizes:')
for name, length in zip(pd_raw.pos_dim_labels, pd_raw.pos_dim_sizes):
    print('{} : {}'.format(name, length))
print('Spectroscopic Dimension names and sizes:')
for name, length in zip(pd_raw.spec_dim_labels, pd_raw.spec_dim_sizes):
    print('{} : {}'.format(name, length))
print('Position Dimensions:')
print(pd_raw.pos_dim_descriptors)
print('Spectroscopic Dimensions:')
print(pd_raw.spec_dim_descriptors)

########################################################################################################################
# Values for each Dimension
# -------------------------
# When visualizing the data it is essential to plot the data against appropriate values on the X, Y, Z axes. The
# PycroDataset object makes it very easy to access the values over which a dimension was varied using the
# ``get_pos_values()`` and ``get_spec_values()`` functions. This functionality is enabled by the ``get_unit_values()``
# function in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils``.
#
# For example, let us say we wanted to see how the ``DC_Offset`` dimension was varied, we could:

dim_name = 'DC_Offset'
dc_vec = pd_raw.get_spec_values(dim_name)
fig, axis = plt.subplots(figsize=(3.5, 3.5))
axis.plot(dc_vec)
axis.set_xlabel('Points in dimension')
axis.set_title(dim_name)
fig.tight_layout()

########################################################################################################################
# Reshaping to N dimensions
# -------------------------
#
# Pycroscopy stores N dimensional datasets in a flattened 2D form of position x spectral values. It can become
# challenging to retrieve the data in its original N-dimensional form, especially for multidimensional datasets
# such as the one we are working on. Fortunately, all the information regarding the dimensionality of the dataset
# are contained in the spectral and position ancillary datasets. PycoDataset makes it remarkably easy to obtain the N
# dimensional form of a dataset:

ndim_form = pd_raw.get_n_dim_form()
print('Shape of the N dimensional form of the dataset:')
print(ndim_form.shape)
print('And these are the dimensions')
print(pd_raw.n_dim_labels)

########################################################################################################################
# Slicing
# -------
# It is often very challenging to grapple with multidimensional datasets such as the one in this example. It may not
# even be possible to load the entire dataset in its 2D or N dimensional form to memory if the dataset is several (or
# several hundred) gigabytes large. Slicing the 2D Main dataset can easily become confusing and frustrating. To solve
# this problem, PycroDataset has a ``slice()`` function that efficiently loads the only the sliced data into memory and
# reshapes the data to an N dimensional form. Best of all, the slicing arguments can be provided in the actual
# N dimensional form!
#
# For example, imagine that we cannot load the entire example dataset in its N dimensional form and then slice it. Lets
# try to get the spatial map for the following conditions without loading the entire dataset in its N dimensional form
# and then slicing it :
#
# * 14th index of DC Offset
# * 1st index of cycle
# * 0th index of Field (remember Python is 0 based)
# * 43rd index of Frequency
#
# To get this, we would slice as:

spat_map_1, success = pd_raw.slice({'Frequency': 43, 'DC_Offset': 14, 'Field': 0, 'Cycle': 1})

########################################################################################################################
# As a verification, lets try to plot the same spatial map by slicing the N dimensional form we got earlier and compare
# it with what we got above:

spat_map_2 = np.squeeze(ndim_form[:, :, 43, 14, 0, 1])
print('2D slicing == ND slicing: {}'.format(np.allclose(spat_map_1, spat_map_2)))

########################################################################################################################
# Interactive Visualization
# ---------------------------
# PycroDatasets also enable quick, interactive, and easy visualization of data up to 2 position and 2 spectroscopic
# dimensions (4D datasets). Since this particular example has 6 dimensions, we would need to slice two dimensions in
# order to visualize the remaining 4 dimensions. Note that this interactive visualization ONLY works on Jupyter
# Notebooks. This html file generated by a python script does not allow for interactive visualization and you may only
# see a set of static plots. We encourage you to click on the
# `Download as Jupyter Notebook <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/_downloads/plot_pycro_dataset.ipynb>`_ button
# below to try it out yourself.

pd_raw.visualize(slice_dict={'Field': 0, 'Cycle': 1})
