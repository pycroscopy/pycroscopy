########################################################################################################################
# Introduction
# -------------
# Pycroscopy uses a data-centric approach to data analysis and processing meaning that results from all data analysis
# and processing are written to the same h5 file that contains the recorded measurements. The Hierarchical Data Format
# (HDF5) allows data, whether it is raw measured data or results of analysis, to be stored in multiple datasets within
# the same file in a tree-like manner. Certain rules and considerations have been made in pycroscopy to ensure
# consistent and easy access to any data.
#
# The h5py python package provides great functions to create, read, and manage data in HDF5 files. In
# pycroscopy.hdf_utils, we have added functions that facilitate scientifically relevant, or pycroscopy specific
# functionality such as checking if a dataset is a Main dataset, reshaping to / from the original N dimensional form of
# the data, etc. Due to the wide breadth of the functions in ``hdf_utils``, the guide for hdf_utils will be split in two
# parts - one that focuses on functions that facilitate reading and one that facilitate writing of data. The following
# guide provides examples of how, and more importantly when, to use functions in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils`` for various
# scenarios.
#
# Recommended pre-requisite reading

#   HDF5 files in pycroscopy
#
# Import all necessary packages
# -------------------------------
#
# Before we begin demonstrating the numerous functions in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils``, we need to import the necessary
# packages. Here are a list of packages besides pycroscopy that will be used in this example:
#
# * ``h5py`` - to open and close the file
# * ``wget`` - to download the example data file
# * ``numpy`` - for numerical operations on arrays in memory
# * ``matplotlib`` - basic visualization of data

from __future__ import print_function, division, unicode_literals
import os
# Warning package in case something goes wrong
from warnings import warn
import subprocess
import sys


def install(package):
    subprocess.call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])
# Package for downloading online files:

try:
    # This package is not part of anaconda and may need to be installed.
    import wget
except ImportError:
    warn('wget not found.  Will install with pip.')
    import pip
    install(wget)
    import wget
import h5py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Finally import pycroscopy.
try:
    import pycroscopy as px
except ImportError:
    warn('pycroscopy not found.  Will install with pip.')
    import pip
    install(pycroscopy)
    import pycroscopy as px

########################################################################################################################
# In order to demonstrate the many functions in hdf_utils, we will be using an pycroscopy HDF5 data file containing real
# experimental data along with results from analyses on the measurement data
#
# This scientific dataset
# -----------------------
#
# For this example, we will be working with a **Band Excitation Polarization Switching (BEPS)** dataset acquired from
# advanced atomic force microscopes. In the much simpler **Band Excitation (BE)** imaging datasets, a single spectra is
# acquired at each location in a two dimensional grid of spatial locations. Thus, BE imaging datasets have two
# position dimensions (``X``, ``Y``) and one spectroscopic dimension (``Frequency`` - against which the spectra is recorded).
# The BEPS dataset used in this example has a spectra for each combination of three other parameters (``DC offset``,
# ``Field``, and ``Cycle``). Thus, this dataset has three new spectral dimensions in addition to the spectra itself. Hence,
# this dataset becomes a 2+4 = **6 dimensional dataset**
#
# Load the dataset
# ------------------
# First, let us download this file from the pycroscopy Github project:

url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/master/data/BEPS_small.h5'
h5_path = 'temp.h5'
_ = wget.download(url, h5_path, bar=None)

print('Working on:\n' + h5_path)

########################################################################################################################
# Next, lets open this HDF5 file in read-only mode. Note that opening the file does not cause the contents to be
# automatically loaded to memory. Instead, we are presented with objects that refer to specific HDF5 datasets,
# attributes or groups in the file

h5_path = 'temp.h5'
h5_f = h5py.File(h5_path, mode='r')

########################################################################################################################
# Here, h5_f is an active handle to the open file
#
# Inspect HDF5 contents
# ======================
#
# The file contents are stored in a tree structure, just like files on a contemporary computer. The file contains
# groups (similar to file folders) and datasets (similar to spreadsheets).
# There are several datasets in the file and these store:
#
# * The actual measurement collected from the experiment
# * Spatial location on the sample where each measurement was collected
# * Information to support and explain the spectral data collected at each location
# * Since pycroscopy stores results from processing and analyses performed on the data in the same file, these
#   datasets and groups are present as well
# * Any other relevant ancillary information
#
# print_tree()
# ------------
# Soon after opening any file, it is often of interest to list the contents of the file. While one can use the open
# source software HDFViewer developed by the HDF organization, ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils`` also has a very handy function -
# ``print_tree()`` to quickly visualize all the datasets and groups within the file within python.

print('Contents of the H5 file:')
px.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_f)

########################################################################################################################
# By default, ``print_tree()`` presents a clean tree view of the contents of the group. In this mode, only the group names
# are underlined. Alternatively, it can print the full  paths of each dataset and group by setting the ``full_paths``
# keyword argument. ``print_tree()`` could also be used to display the contents of and HDF5 group instead of complete HDF5
# file as we have done above. Lets configure it to print the relative paths of all objects within the ``Channel_000``
# group:

px.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_f['/Measurement_000/Channel_000/'], rel_paths=True)

########################################################################################################################
# Finally, ``print_tree()`` can also be configured to only print Pycroscopy Main datasets besides Group objects using the
# ``main_dsets_only`` option

px.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_f, main_dsets_only=True)

########################################################################################################################
# Accessing Attributes
# ==================================
#
# HDF5 datasets and datagroups can also store metadata such as experimental parameters. These metadata can be text,
# numbers, small lists of numbers or text etc. These metadata can be very important for understanding the datasets
# and guide the analysis routines.
#
# While one could use the basic h5py functionality to access attributes, one would encounter a lot of problems when
# attempting to decode attributes whose values were strings or lists of strings due to some issues in h5py. This problem
# has been demonstrated in our primer to HDF5. Instead of using the basic functionality of h5py, we recommend always
# using the functions in pycroscopy that reliably and consistently work for any kind of attribute for any version of
# python:
#
# get_attributes()
# ----------------
#
# ``get_attributes()`` is a very handy function that returns all or a specified set of attributes in an HDF5 object. If no
# attributes are explicitly requested, all attributes in the object are returned:

for key, val in px.hdf_utils.get_attributes(h5_f).items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))

########################################################################################################################
# ``get_attributes()`` is also great for only getting selected attributes. For example, if we only cared about the user
# and project related attributes, we could manually request for any that we wanted:

proj_attrs = px.hdf_utils.get_attributes(h5_f, ['project_name', 'project_id', 'user_name'])
for key, val in proj_attrs.items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))

########################################################################################################################
# get_attr()
# ----------
#
# If were sure that we only wanted a specific attribute, we could instead use ``get_attr()`` as:


print(px.hdf_utils.get_attr(h5_f, 'user_name'))

########################################################################################################################
# check_for_matching_attrs()
# --------------------------
# Consider the scenario where we are have several HDF5 files or Groups or datasets and we wanted to check each one to
# see if they have the certain metadata / attributes. ``check_for_matching_attrs()`` is one very handy function that
# simplifies the comparision operation.
#
# For example, let us check if this file was authored by 'John Doe':

print(px.hdf_utils.check_for_matching_attrs(h5_f, new_parms={'user_name': 'John Doe'}))

########################################################################################################################
# Finding datasets and groups
# ============================
#
# There are numerous ways to search for and access datasets and groups in H5 files using the basic functionalities
# of h5py. pycroscopy.hdf_utils contains several functions that simplify common searching / lookup operations as part of
# scientific workflows.
#
# find_dataset()
# ----------------
#
# The ``find_dataset()`` function will return all datasets that whose names contain the provided string. In this case, we
# are looking for any datasets containing the string ``UDVS`` in their names. If you look above, there are two datasets
# (UDVS and UDVS_Indices) that match this condition:

udvs_dsets_2 = px.hdf_utils.find_dataset(h5_f, 'UDVS')
for item in udvs_dsets_2:
    print(item)

########################################################################################################################
# As you might know by now, Pycroscopy HDF5 files contain three kinds of datasets:
#
# * ``Main`` datasets that contain data recorded / computed at multiple spatial locations.
# * ``Ancillary`` datasets that support a main dataset
# * Other datasets
#
# For more information, please refer to the documentation on the pycroscopy data format.
#
# check_if_main()
# ---------------
# ``check_if_main()`` is a very handy function that helps distinguish between ``Main`` datasets and other objects
# (``Ancillary`` datasets, other datasets, Groups etc.). Lets apply this function to see which of the objects within the
# ``Channel_000`` Group are Main datasets:

h5_chan_group = h5_f['Measurement_000/Channel_000']

# We will prepare two lists - one of objects that are main and one of objects that are not

non_main_objs = []
main_objs = []
for key, val in h5_chan_group.items():
    if px.hdf_utils.check_if_main(val):
        main_objs.append(key)
    else:
        non_main_objs.append(key)

# Now we simply print the names of the items in each list

print('Main Datasets:')
print('----------------')
for item in main_objs:
    print(item)
print('\nObjects that were not Main datasets:')
print('--------------------------------------')
for item in non_main_objs:
    print(item)

########################################################################################################################
# The above script allowed us to distinguish Main datasets from all other objects only within the Group named
# ``Channel_000``.
#
# get_all_main()
# --------------
# What if we want to quickly find all ``Main`` datasets even within the sub-Groups of ``Channel_000``? To do this, we have a
# very handy function called - ``get_all_main()``:

main_dsets = px.hdf_utils.get_all_main(h5_chan_group)
for dset in main_dsets:
    print(dset)
    print('--------------------------------------------------------------------')

########################################################################################################################
# The datasets above show that the file contains three main datasets. Two of these datasets are contained in a HDF5
# Group called ``Raw_Data-SHO_Fit_000`` meaning that they are results of an operation called ``SHO_Fit`` performed on the
# ``Main`` dataset - ``Raw_Data``. The first of the three main datasets is indeed the ``Raw_Data`` dataset from which the
# latter two datasets (``Fit`` and ``Guess``) were derived.
#
# Pycroscopy allows the same operation, such as ``SHO_Fit``, to be performed on the same dataset (``Raw_Data``), multiple
# times. Each time the operation is performed, a new HDF5 Group is created to hold the new results. Often, we may
# want to perform a few operations such as:
#
# * Find the (source / main) dataset from which certain results were derived
# * Check if a particular operation was performed on a main dataset
# * Find all groups corresponding to a particular operation (e.g. - ``SHO_Fit``) being applied to a Main dataset
#
# ``hdf_utils`` has a few handy functions for many of these use cases.
#
# find_results_groups()
# ----------------------
# First, lets show that ``find_results_groups()`` finds all Groups containing the results of a ``SHO_Fit`` operation applied
# to ``Raw_Data``:

# First get the dataset corresponding to Raw_Data
h5_raw = h5_chan_group['Raw_Data']

operation = 'SHO_Fit'
print('Instances of operation "{}" applied to dataset named "{}":'.format(operation, h5_raw.name))
h5_sho_group_list = px.hdf_utils.find_results_groups(h5_raw, operation)
print(h5_sho_group_list)

########################################################################################################################
# As expected, the ``SHO_Fit`` operation was performed on ``Raw_Data`` dataset only once, which is why
# ``find_results_groups()`` returned only one HDF5 Group - ``SHO_Fit_000``.
#
# check_for_old()
# -----------------
#
# Often one may want to check if a certain operation was performed on a dataset with the very same parameters to
# avoid recomputing the results. ``hdf_utils.check_for_old()`` is a very handy function that compares parameters (a
# dictionary) for a new / potential operation against the metadata (attributes) stored in each existing results group
# (HDF5 groups whose name starts with ``Raw_Data-SHO_Fit`` in this case). Before we demonstrate ``check_for_old()``, lets
# take a look at the attributes stored in the existing results groups:

print('Parameters already used for computing SHO_Fit on Raw_Data in the file:')
for key, val in px.hdf_utils.get_attributes(h5_chan_group['Raw_Data-SHO_Fit_000']).items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))

########################################################################################################################
# Now, let us check for existing results where the ``SHO_fit_method`` attribute matches an existing value and a new value:

print('Checking to see if SHO Fits have been computed on the raw dataset:')
print('\nUsing "pycroscopy BESHO":')
print(px.hdf_utils.check_for_old(h5_raw, 'SHO_Fit',
                                 new_parms={'SHO_fit_method': 'pycroscopy BESHO'}))
print('\nUsing "alternate technique"')
print(px.hdf_utils.check_for_old(h5_raw, 'SHO_Fit',
                                 new_parms={'SHO_fit_method': 'alternate technique'}))

########################################################################################################################
# Clearly, while find_results_groups() returned any and all groups corresponding to ``SHO_Fit`` being applied to
# ``Raw_Data``, ``check_for_old()`` only returned the group(s) where the operation was performed using the same specified
# parameters (``sho_fit_method`` in this case).
#
# Note that ``check_for_old()`` performs two operations - search for all groups with the matching nomenclature and then
# compare the attributes. ``check_for_matching_attrs()`` is the handy function, that enables the latter operation of
# comparing a giving dictionary of parameters against attributes in a given object.
#
# get_source_dataset()
# ---------------------
# ``hdf_utils.get_source_dataset()`` is a very handy function for the inverse scenario where we are interested in finding
# the source dataset from which the known result was derived:

h5_sho_group = h5_sho_group_list[0]
print('Datagroup containing the SHO fits:')
print(h5_sho_group)
print('\nDataset on which the SHO Fit was computed:')
h5_source_dset = px.hdf_utils.get_source_dataset(h5_sho_group)
print(h5_source_dset)

########################################################################################################################
# Since the source dataset is always a ``Main`` dataset, ``get_source_dataset()`` results a ``PycroDataset`` object instead of
# a regular ``HDF5 Dataset`` object.
#
# Note that ``hdf_utils.get_source_dataset()`` and ``find_results_groups()`` rely on the Pycroscopy rule that results of an
# operation be stored in a Group named ``Source_Dataset_Name-Operation_Name_00x``.

# get_auxiliary_datasets()
# -------------------------
# The association of datasets and groups with one another provides a powerful mechanism for conveying (richer)
# information. One way to associate objects with each other is to store the reference of an object as an attribute of
# another. This is precisely the capability that is leveraged to turn Central datasets into Pycroscopy Main Datasets or
# ``PycroDatasets``. PycroDatasets need to have four attributes that are references to the ``Position`` and ``Spectroscopic``
# ``ancillary`` datasets. Note, that pycroscopy does not restrict or preclude the storage of other relevant datasets as
# attributes of another dataset.
#
# For example, the ``Raw_Data`` dataset appears to contain several attributes whose keys / names match the names of
# datasets we see above and values all appear to be HDF5 object references:

for key, val in px.hdf_utils.get_attributes(h5_raw).items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))

########################################################################################################################
# As the name suggests, these HDF5 object references are references or addresses to datasets located elsewhere in the
# file. Conventionally, one would need to apply this reference to the file handle to get the actual HDF5 Dataset / Group
# object.
#
# ``get_auxiliary_datasets()`` simplifies this process by directly retrieving the actual Dataset / Group associated with
# the attribute. Thus, we would be able to get a reference to the ``Bin_Frequencies`` Dataset via:

h5_obj = px.hdf_utils.get_auxiliary_datasets(h5_raw, 'Bin_Frequencies')[0]
print(h5_obj)
# Lets prove that this object is the same as the 'Bin_Frequencies' object that can be directly addressed:
print(h5_obj == h5_f['/Measurement_000/Channel_000/Bin_Frequencies'])

########################################################################################################################
# Accessing Ancillary Datasets
# =============================
# One of the major benefits of Pycroscopy is its ability to handle large multidimensional datasets at ease. ``Ancillary``
# datasets serve as the keys or legends for explaining the dimensionality, reshape-ability, etc. of a dataset. There are
# several functions in hdf_utils that simplify many common operations on ancillary datasets.
#
# Before we demonstrate the several useful functions in hdf_utils, lets access the position and spectroscopic ancillary
# datasets using the ``get_auxiliary_datasets()`` function we used above:

dset_list = px.hdf_utils.get_auxiliary_datasets(h5_raw, ['Position_Indices', 'Position_Values',
                                                         'Spectroscopic_Indices', 'Spectroscopic_Values'])
h5_pos_inds, h5_pos_vals, h5_spec_inds, h5_spec_vals = dset_list

########################################################################################################################
# get_formatted_labels()
# ----------------------
# ``get_formatted_labels()`` provides a string representation of the dimensions represented by an ancillary dataset. Lets
# try it out on the ``Position Indices`` and ``Spectroscopic Indices`` datasets:

pos_dim_names = px.hdf_utils.get_formatted_labels(h5_pos_inds)
spec_dim_names = px.hdf_utils.get_formatted_labels(h5_spec_inds)

print('Position dimensions are:')
print(pos_dim_names)
print('\nSpectroscopic dimensions are:')
print(spec_dim_names)

########################################################################################################################
# As mentioned above, this is indeed a six dimensional dataset with two position dimensions and four spectroscopic
# dimensions. The ``Field`` and ``Cycle`` dimensions do not have any units since they are dimensionless unlike the other
# dimensions.
#
# get_dimensionality()
# ---------------------
# Now lets find out the number of steps in each of those dimensions using another handy function called
# ``get_dimensionality()``:

pos_dim_sizes = px.hdf_utils.get_dimensionality(h5_pos_inds)
spec_dim_sizes = px.hdf_utils.get_dimensionality(h5_spec_inds)

print('Size of each Position dimension:')
for name, length in zip(pos_dim_names, pos_dim_sizes):
    print('{} : {}'.format(name, length))
print('\nSize of each Spectroscopic dimension:')
for name, length in zip(spec_dim_names, spec_dim_sizes):
    print('{} : {}'.format(name, length))

########################################################################################################################
# get_sort_order()
# ----------------
#
# In a few (rare) cases, the spectroscopic / position dimensions are not arranged in descending order of rate of change.
# In other words, the dimensions in these ancillary matrices are not arranged from fastest-varying to slowest.
# To account for such discrepancies, ``hdf_utils`` has a very handy function that goes through each of the columns or
# rows in the ancillary indices matrices and finds the order in which these dimensions vary.
#
# Below we illustrate an example of sorting the names of the spectroscopic dimensions from fastest to slowest in
# the BEPS data file:

spec_sort_order = px.hdf_utils.get_sort_order(h5_spec_inds)
print('Rate of change of spectroscopic dimensions: {}'.format(spec_sort_order))
print('\nSpectroscopic dimensions arranged as is:')
unsorted_spec_labels = px.hdf_utils.get_formatted_labels(h5_spec_inds)
print(unsorted_spec_labels)
sorted_spec_labels = np.array(unsorted_spec_labels)[np.array(spec_sort_order)]
print('\nSpectroscopic dimensions arranged from fastest to slowest')
print(sorted_spec_labels)

########################################################################################################################
# get_unit_values()
# -----------------
#
# When visualizing the data it is essential to plot the data against appropriate values on the X, Y, or Z axes.
# Recall that by definition that the values over which each dimension is varied, are repeated and tiled over the entire
# position or spectroscopic dimension of the dataset. Thus, if we had just the bias waveform repeated over two cycles,
# spectroscopic values would contain the bias waveform tiled twice and the cycle numbers repeated as many times as the
# number of points in the bias waveform. Therefore, extracting the bias waveform or the cycle numbers from the ancillary
# datasets is not trivial. This problem is especially challenging for multidimensional datasets such as the one under
# consideration. Fortunately, ``hdf_utils`` has a very handy function for this as well:

pos_unit_values = px.hdf_utils.get_unit_values(h5_pos_inds, h5_pos_vals)
print('Position unit values:')
for key, val in pos_unit_values.items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))
spec_unit_values = px.hdf_utils.get_unit_values(h5_spec_inds, h5_spec_vals)

########################################################################################################################
# Since the spectroscopic dimensions are quite complicated, lets visualize the results from ``get_unit_values()``:

fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2, figsize=(6.5, 6))
for axis, name in zip(axes.flat, spec_dim_names):
    axis.set_title(name)
    name, units = name.split()
    axis.plot(spec_unit_values[name], 'o-')

fig.suptitle('Spectroscopic Dimensions', fontsize=16, y=1.05)
fig.tight_layout()

########################################################################################################################
# Reshaping Data
# ==============
#
# reshape_to_n_dims()
# -------------------
#
# Pycroscopy stores N dimensional datasets in a flattened 2D form of position x spectral values. It can become
# challenging to retrieve the data in its original N-dimensional form, especially for multidimensional datasets such as
# the one we are working on. Fortunately, all the information regarding the dimensionality of the dataset are contained
# in the spectral and position ancillary datasets. ``reshape_to_n_dims()`` is a very useful function that can help
# retrieve the N-dimensional form of the data using a simple function call:

ndim_form, success, labels = px.hdf_utils.reshape_to_n_dims(h5_raw, get_labels=True)
if success:
    print('Succeeded in reshaping flattened 2D dataset to N dimensions')
    print('Shape of the data in its original 2D form')
    print(h5_raw.shape)
    print('Shape of the N dimensional form of the dataset:')
    print(ndim_form.shape)
    print('And these are the dimensions')
    print(labels)
else:
    print('Failed in reshaping the dataset')

########################################################################################################################
# reshape_from_n_dims()
# -----------------------
# The inverse problem of reshaping an N dimensional dataset back to a 2D dataset (let's say for the purposes of
# multivariate analysis or storing into Pycroscopy formatted HDF5 files) is also easily solved using another handy
# function - ``reshape_from_n_dims()``:

two_dim_form, success = px.hdf_utils.reshape_from_n_dims(ndim_form, h5_pos=h5_pos_inds, h5_spec=h5_spec_inds)
if success:
    print('Shape of flattened two dimensional form')
    print(two_dim_form.shape)
else:
    print('Failed in flattening the N dimensional dataset')
