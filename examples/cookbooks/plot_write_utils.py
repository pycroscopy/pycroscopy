# Introduction
# -------------
# Pycroscopy takes a truly unique approach towards towards storing scientific observational data. Several helper
# functions are necessary to simplify the actual file writing process. ``pycroscopy.write_utils`` is the home for those
# utilities that assist in writing data but do not directly interact with HDF5 files (as in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils``).
# ``pycroscopy.write_utils`` consist mainly of two broad categories of functions:
# * functions that assist in building ancillary datasets
# * miscellaneous functions that assist in formatting data
#
# **Note that most of these are low-level functions that are used by popular high level functions in
# pycroscopy.hdf_utils to simplify the writing of datasets.**
#
# Recommended pre-requisite reading
# ----------------------------------
# * `pycroscopy data format <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/data_format.html>`_
#
# What to read after this
# -------------------------
# * `Crash course on HDF5 and h5py <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_h5py.html>`_

#   HDF5 files in pycroscopy
#
# Import necessary packages
# --------------------------
# We only need a handful of packages besides pycroscopy to illustrate the functions in ``pycroscopy.write_utils``:
#
# * ``numpy`` - for numerical operations on arrays in memory
# * ``matplotlib`` - basic visualization of data
# * ``pycroscopy`` itself

# Building Ancillary datasets
# ============================
# Pycroscopy uses pairs of ``ancillary matrices`` to support the instrument-independent and compact representation of
# multidimensional datasets. While the creation of ``ancillary datasets`` is straightforward when the number of position
# and spectroscopic dimensions are relatively small (0-2), one needs to be careful when building these
# ``ancillary datasets`` for datasets with large number of position / spectroscopic dimensions (> 2). The main challenge
# involves the careful tiling and repetition of unit vectors for each dimension with respect to the sizes of all other
# dimensions. Fortunately, ``pycroscopy.write_utils`` has many handy functions that solve this problem.
#
# In order to demonstrate the functions, lets say that we are working on an example ``Main dataset`` that has three
# spectroscopic dimensions (``Bias``, ``Field``, ``Cycle``). The Bias dimension varies as a bi-polar triangular waveform. This
# waveform is repeated for two Fields over 3 Cycles meaning that the ``Field`` and ``Cycle`` dimensions are far simpler than
# the ``Bias`` dimension in that they have linearly increasing / decreasing values.

max_v = 4
half_pts = 8
bi_triang = np.roll(np.hstack((np.linspace(-max_v, max_v, half_pts, endpoint=False),
                               np.linspace(max_v, -max_v, half_pts, endpoint=False))), -half_pts // 2)
cycles = [0, 1, 2]
fields = [1, -1]

dim_names = ['Bias', 'Field', 'Cycles']

fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(10, 3.5))
for axis, name, vec in zip(axes.flat, dim_names, [bi_triang, fields, cycles]):
    axis.plot(vec, 'o-')
    axis.set_title(name, fontsize=14)
fig.suptitle('Unit values for each dimension', fontsize=16, y=1.05)
fig.tight_layout()

########################################################################################################################
# make_indices_matrix()
# ---------------------
# One half of the work for generating the ancillary datasets is generating the ``indices matrix``. The
# ``make_indices_matrix()`` function solves this problem. All one needs to do is supply a list with the lengths of each
# dimension. The result is a 2D matrix of shape: (3 dimensions, points in ``Bias``[``16``] * points in ``Field``[``2``] * points
# in ``Cycle``[``3``]) = ``(3, 96)``.

inds = px.write_utils.make_indices_matrix([len(bi_triang), len(fields), len(cycles)], is_position=False)
print('Generated indices of shape: {}'.format(inds.shape))

# The plots below show a visual representation of the indices for each dimension:
fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(10, 3.5))
for axis, name, vec in zip(axes.flat, dim_names, inds):
    axis.plot(vec)
    axis.set_title(name, fontsize=14)
fig.suptitle('Indices for each dimension', fontsize=16, y=1.05)
fig.tight_layout()

########################################################################################################################
# build_ind_val_matrices()
# --------------------------
# ``make_indices_matrix()`` is a very handy function but it only solves one of the problems - the indices matrix. We also
# need the matrix with the values tiled and repeated in the same manner. Perhaps one of the most useful functions is
# ``build_ind_val_matrices()`` which uses just the values over which each dimension is varied to automatically generate
# the indices and values matrices that form the ancillary datasets.
#
# In order to generate the indices and values matrices, we would just need to provide the list of values over which
# these dimensions are varied to ``build_ind_val_matrices()``. The results are two matrices - one for the indices and the
# other for the values, of the same shape ``(3, 96)``.
#
# As mentioned in our document about the `data structuring <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/data_format.html>`_,
# the ``Bias`` would be in the first row, followed by ``Field``, finally followed by ``Cycle``. The plots below illustrate
# what the indices and values look like for each dimension. For example, notice how the bipolar triangular bias vector
# has been repeated 2 (``Field``) * 3 (``Cycle``) times. Also note how the indices vector is a saw-tooth waveform that also
# repeats in the same manner.  The repeated + tiled indices and values vectors for ``Cycle`` and ``Field`` look the same /
# very similar since they were simple linearly increasing values to start with.

inds, vals = px.write_utils.build_ind_val_matrices([bi_triang, fields, cycles], is_spectral=True)
print('Indices and values of shape: {}'.format(inds.shape))

fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(10, 3.5))
for axis, name, vec in zip(axes.flat, dim_names, inds):
    axis.plot(vec)
    axis.set_title(name, fontsize=14)
fig.suptitle('Indices for each dimension', fontsize=16, y=1.05)
fig.tight_layout()

fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(10, 3.5))

# create_spec_inds_from_vals()
# ------------------------------
# When writing analysis functions or classes wherein one or more (typically spectroscopic) dimensions are dropped as a
# consequence of dimensionality reduction, new ancillary spectroscopic datasets need to be generated when writing the
# reduced data back to the file. ``create_spec_inds_from_vals()`` is a handy function when we need to generate the indices
# matrix that corresponds to a values matrix. For this example, lets assume that we only have the values matrix but need
# to generate the indices matrix from this:

inds = px.write_utils.create_spec_inds_from_vals(vals)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(10, 3.5))
for axis, name, vec in zip(axes.flat, dim_names, inds):
    axis.plot(vec)
    axis.set_title(name, fontsize=14)
fig.suptitle('Indices for each dimension', fontsize=16, y=1.05)
fig.tight_layout()

########################################################################################################################
# get_aux_dset_slicing()
# ------------------------
# ``Region references`` are a handy feature in HDF5 that allow users to refer to a certain section of data within a
# dataset by name rather than the indices that define the region of interest.
#
# In pycroscopy, we use region references to define the row or column in the ``ancillary dataset`` that corresponds to
# each dimension by its name. In other words, if we only wanted the ``Field`` dimension we could directly get the data
# corresponding to this dimension without having to remember or figure out the index in which this dimension exists.
#
# Let's take the example of the Field dimension which occurs at index 1 in the ``(3, 96)`` shaped spectroscopic index /
# values matrix. We could extract the ``Field`` dimension from the 2D matrix by slicing each dimension using slice objects
# . We need the second row so the first dimension would be sliced as ``slice(start=1, stop=2)``. We need all the colummns
# in the second dimension so we would slice as ``slice(start=None, stop=None)`` meaning that we need all the columns.
# Doing this by hand for each dimension is clearly tedious.
#
# ``get_aux_dset_slicing()`` helps generate the instructions for region references for each dimension in an ancillary
# dataset. The instructions for each region reference in ``h5py`` are defined by tuples of slice objects. Lets see the
# region-reference instructions that this function provides for our aforementioned example dataset with the three
# spectroscopic dimensions.

print('Region references slicing instructions for Spectroscopic dimensions:')
ret_val = px.write_utils.get_aux_dset_slicing(dim_names, is_spectroscopic=True)
for key, val in ret_val.items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))

print('\nRegion references slicing instructions for Position dimensions:')
ret_val = px.write_utils.get_aux_dset_slicing(['X', 'Y'], is_spectroscopic=False)
for key, val in ret_val.items():
    print('{} : {}'.format(key, val))

########################################################################################################################
# Dimension
# ----------
# In pycroscopy, ``position`` and ``spectroscopic dimensions`` are defined using some basic information that will be
# incorporated in ``Dimension`` objects that contain three vital pieces of information:
#
# * ``name`` of the dimension
# * ``units`` for the dimension
# * ``values``:
#     * These can be the actual values over which the dimension was varied
#     * or number of steps in case of linearly varying dimensions such as 'Cycle' below
#
# These objects will be heavily used for creating ``Main`` or ``ancillary datasets`` in ``pycroscopy.hdf_utils`` and even to
# set up interactive jupyter Visualizers in ``pycroscopy.PycroDataset``.
#
# Note that the ``Dimension`` objects in the lists for ``Position`` and ``Spectroscopic`` must be arranged from fastest
# varying to slowest varying to mimic how the data is actually arranged. For example, in this example, there are
# multiple bias points per field and multiple fields per cycle. Thus, the bias changes faster than the field and the
# field changes faster than the cycle. Therefore, the ``Bias`` must precede ``Field`` which will precede ``Cycle``. Let's
# assume that we were describing the spectroscopic dimensions for this example dataset to some other pycroscopy function
# , we would describe the spectroscopic dimensions as:

spec_dims = [px.write_utils.Dimension('Bias', 'V', bi_triang),
             px.write_utils.Dimension('Fields', '', fields),
             # for the sake of example, since we know that cycles is linearly increasing from 0 with a step size of 1,
             # we can specify such a simply dimension via just the length of that dimension:
             px.write_utils.Dimension('Cycle', '', len(cycles))]

########################################################################################################################
# The application of the Dimension objects will be a lot more apparent in the document about the `writing functions in
# pycroscopy.hdf_utils <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_hdf_utils_write.html>`_.
#
# Misc writing utilities
# ========================
#
# calc_chunks()
# --------------
# The ``h5py`` package automatically (virtually) breaks up HDF5 datasets into contiguous ``chunks`` to speed up reading and
# writing of datasets. In certain situations the default mode of chunking may not result in the highest performance.
# In such cases, it helps in chunking the dataset manually. The ``calc_chunks()`` function helps in calculating
# appropriate chunk sizes for the dataset using some apriori knowledge about the way the data would be accessed, the
# size of each element in the dataset, maximum size for a single chunk, etc. The examples below illustrate a few ways on
# how to use this function:

dimensions = (16384, 16384 * 4)
dtype_bytesize = 4
ret_val = px.write_utils.calc_chunks(dimensions, dtype_bytesize)
print(ret_val)

dimensions = (16384, 16384 * 4)
dtype_bytesize = 4
unit_chunks = (3, 7)
max_mem = 50000
ret_val = px.write_utils.calc_chunks(dimensions, dtype_bytesize, unit_chunks=unit_chunks, max_chunk_mem=max_mem)
print(ret_val)

# clean_string_att()
# -------------------
# As mentioned in our `HDF5 primer <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_h5py.html>`_,
# the ``h5py`` package used for reading and manipulating HDF5 files has issues which necessitate the encoding of
# attributes whose values are lists of strings. The ``clean_string_att()`` encodes lists of
# strings correctly so that they can directly be written to HDF5 without causing any errors. All other kinds of simple
# attributes - single strings, numbers, lists of numbers are unmodified by this function.

expected = ['a', 'bc', 'def']
returned = px.write_utils.clean_string_att(expected)
print('List of strings value: {} encoded to: {}'.format(expected, returned))

expected = [1, 2, 3.456]
returned = px.write_utils.clean_string_att(expected)
print('List of numbers value: {} returned as is: {}'.format(expected, returned))
