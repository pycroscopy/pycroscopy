Guides to Pycroscopy
--------------------
* The documents below should be sufficient for you to learn how to use and even write code for pycroscopy.
* If you haven't already, please go through the external tutorials on python, scientific data analysis in python, etc.
* All the documents listed below will assume that you understand the pycroscopy data format. Please read that document before beginning

To learn how to use pycroscopy, go through the following documents in the recommended order:

1. Primer to h5py
2. The PycroDataset
3. Data translation and the NumpyTranslator
4. Plot utilities (not necessary to learn pycroscopy but we have several functions you are likely to find handy)
5. Utilities to read pycroscopy HDF5 files
6. Data type manipulation utilities
7. Parallel computation

To learn how to write to pycroscopy HDF5 files, write data processing classes, or adding functionality to pycroscopy, go through these additional documents in the recommended order:

8. Utilities that assist in writing data
9. Utilities to write pycroscopy HDF5 files
10. Formalizing Data Processing
11. Input / Output / Computing utilities
